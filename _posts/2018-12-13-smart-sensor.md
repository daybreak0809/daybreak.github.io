## BASIC IDEA

{% include image.html url="/media/2018-12-13-smart-sensor/1.jpeg" width="100%" description="basic idea." %}
We wanted a coffee delivery service because we can pursue the efficiency of work in the cafe.

## BASIC CONCEPT AND DESIGN

{% include image.html url="/media/2018-12-13-smart-sensor/2.jpeg" width="100%" description="basic concept and design." %}

We transformed the main plot of the movie 'KIKI's delivery service' and used it as our basic stoy. We changed the main charactor as a cat to appeal customors about the cuteness of cats. And the images on the right side are the first designs we imagined. 

## development of idea and design --> FINAL MODEL

{% include image.html url="/media/2018-12-13-smart-sensor/3.jpeg" width="100%" description="final concept and design." %}
At first, we imagined KIKI as a cat. But considering Christmas season, we decided to change our cat to a rudulf delivers coffee as a present to people.
